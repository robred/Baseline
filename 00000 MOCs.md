Maps of Content #mocs #maps-of-content are preferred to using a folder structure. If you're unfamiliar with [MOCs](#mocs), they are what they sound like: a map of your notes made from two way (backlinking) hyperlinks.

These can be created many ways; the easiest is to simply start thinking, writing and linking.  This Obsidian project uses a single hub page to list all of the MOCs that are available as a starter project aid.
